# Python-Shoes-Project
 This project contains code that describes shoes using object-oriented programing concepts such as polymorphism,inheritence,abstract classes,pattern programming,unit tests.
 
 Project models shoe management system,it provides memory safety handling for different methods like adding items to the list,retrieving items from the list,ensuring the index within bounds.
 
 Abstact base class shoe Was implemented.Several classes inherited from the class "Shoe" : sport shoe,casual shoe,formal shoe. 
 
 Each shoe class has a method to display its information.It displays details about shoe.Here is the list of shoe parameters which are implemented : material,color,size,
 brand,season,gender.Each class has its own file,including abstract base class.
 
 A memory-safe list class is implemented to handle dynamic array safely.
 
 The project also employs the factory design pattern to decouple object creation from class implementation, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
 
 Unit tests are also implemented.Using unit test framework tests cover the functionality of shoe classes and the memory-safe list.
